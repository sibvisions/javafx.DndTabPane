# javafx.DndTabPane

This repository holds a Drag'n'Drop extended TabPane which is an extension
of the default JavaFX TabPane.

This TabPane was written by Tom Schindl at [BestSolution](http://bestsolution.at)
and is part of the "org.eclipse.fx.ui.controls" bundle which itself is part of
the [SWT on JavaFX](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Efxclipse/SWTonFX) efforts.

It has been extracted for easier reusability in the [JVx JavaFX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jvxfx/)
project.

[RT-19659](https://javafx-jira.kenai.com/browse/RT-19659) is the request which
is concerned with getting such a functionality into the default JavaFX TabPane.
It is at the moment slated for version 9.
